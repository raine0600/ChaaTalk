# ChaaTalk
Assessment No. 4
ChaTalk is a real-time app that lets you communicate with people all over the world once they join the same server as you. 

This project is not yet complete since the language that was used is very new to me and it actually gave me an eyeopener to how broad programming is. While doing the project, I am
both frustrated and genuinly excited because even though it is challenging, I get to still program and even went 80% of finishing the project.

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher) - https://nodejs.org/en
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- VS Code

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:
open terminal
input "cd client"
input "npm run dev code"
Copy "http://localhost:5173/" to the browser

or
Simply input  "http://localhost:5173/" to the browser to view the application
